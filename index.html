When I was little, <br>
a fortune teller said I will do a job in politics, maybe a legislator.<br>
I was so disappointed and not happy.<br>
Politics is nasty, not elegant, masculine to me at that time.<br>
 I made up my mind never to let this happen.<br>
<br>
When I was in elementary school,<br>
I asked my dad why there are so many conflicts after Chen elected president.<br>
My dad reply to me that kids should stay away from politics.<br>
<br>
In my Sophomore year of college,<br> Sunflower Student Movement happened in Taiwan.<br>
 I sleep on the street in front of the legislature with my classmates to protest the trade pact with China that would hurt Taiwan's economy and leave it vulnerable to political pressure from Beijing.<br>
<br>
Two years later, <br>
I was the first time voter<br>
and Tsai was elected Taiwan’s first female president.<br>
<br>
When I was 25 years old, <br>
I came to the states.<br>
I stand firm in my position as a Taiwanese among the majority of Chinese classmates.<br>
One of my friends told me the Chinese laugh me Taiwan's pro-independence idiot behind my back.<br>
<br>
Everything is political is even more true for Taiwanese, we are luckily unlucky to be in this period.<br>
<br>
When I told my mom I am doing a project about Taiwanese political status, she asks me not to talk in a too aggressive and confrontational way.<br>

          #from here#<br>
<br>
I picked up a random stone after my 8:30 p.m. class.<br>
<br>
The stone was under the tree across Pollack building. I believe that tree had lots of unique features worth introducing. But I paid all my attention to staring at the ground to look for a stone. I don’t even remember how its trunk looked like. It was my problem though.<br>
<br>
The first stone that came into view was the one in a triangle shape and with round corners. It reminds me of Japanese rice balls.<br>
<br>
If the stone knew why I picked it, I bet it would be disappointed. The reason is no reason. It was the first stone I saw, so I chose it. If it was other stones that sit there, I would pick them up too… I know this is not a decent reason. People would usually expect a deep and strong meaning behind a decision. I feel like I could fake so many reasons to make the stone sound more valuable. But I just can’t lie to myself, and the stone.<br>
<br>
I picked it up and put in my bag, I felt like I shouldn’t hold in my hands all the way home. Because I cannot see what was on in the night. There should be mud, I could feel the mud. If worse, there would be some bugs, and the worst should be the COVID virus, which I would never be able to see with my eyes.<br>
<br>
I took home, place on the upside-down container, put some lights on, and I started to draw, everyday…. Sometimes I drew right after I got off my bed, and before I went to bed. Sometimes I drew when I felt like I was about to explode. But every time, I would pay attention to the sounds around me when I drew. Most of the time, I listened to a song that best described my feeling, but there was also a time I drew with the water boiling in the kettle beside my head, or just the midnight white noise in my room (I’d like to tell you more about that white noise in my room, but I haven’t figured out where does that machine roaring noise come from…. normally I don’t notice the roaring sounds until the moment it stops… but I’m sure there’s also some insects and birds chirping in between those roaring noise)<br>
<br>
II don’t know if I should define this series as sound drawings, my mood diary, or portraits of a random stone. But it definitely is a mix of every random and plain thing, a stone from nowhere, the emotions from nowhere, and the sounds from nowhere. The most definite thing is this piece is the time.<br>
<br>
There’s no certain way to enjoy this piece, you could read it, listen to it or feel it with your hands. All the photos and drawings are the life size of the stone. I think the stone wouldn’t mind how it is viewed, heard and touched because it didn’t refuse when I picked it up. It was silent like a moon behind heavy clouds. Maybe it was screaming silently inside itself, but there’s no way I can turn the stone inside out. So I will just give this overbearing conclusion.<br>
