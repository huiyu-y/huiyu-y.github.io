      <h2>Likely Editions</h2>

      <p>Brand Identity, April 2023.</p>

      <p>
        Likely Editions is an independent space managed by a designer and archivist that aims to promote and expand the concept of artists' books in Taiwan.<br>
        <br>
        They showcase and support self-publishing projects that may not fit the usual definition of an artistsâ€™ book in Taiwan. Their vision is to encourage more discussion, thought, and creativity about the practice of artists' books in Taiwan, and
        to foster a flexible understanding of this genre.<br>
        <br>
        The primary graphic system utilizes the form of the letter "i," which resembles the spine of a book. By rotating the "i," an open space is created that embodies their mission of making room for various publication ideas. The rotated layout of
        titles is repeated in various deliveries. It corresponds to the italicized logotype and visualizes the organization's resistance to fixed definitions.
